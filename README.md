🚦 AI-Powered Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System
🧩 Project Overview

The AI-Powered Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) to optimize traffic flow in real time.
By analyzing live data from cameras and sensors, the system adjusts signal timings automatically to reduce congestion, improve road safety, and prioritize emergency vehicles.





🤖 Key Features

⚡ Real-Time Adaptability: Adjusts traffic light durations based on live vehicle density.

🧠 AI-Driven Decision Making: Uses machine learning and computer vision to manage intersections intelligently.

🚑 Emergency Vehicle Priority: Detects ambulances and fire trucks to create green corridors instantly.

📊 Traffic Analytics Dashboard: Displays traffic flow data, congestion levels, and emission reduction statistics.

🌍 Scalable & Upgradable: Can be deployed across multiple intersections with easy future updates.

💡 Eco-Friendly Impact: Reduces fuel use and emissions by minimizing idle time at signals.

🖥️ User-Friendly Interface: Simple dashboard for operators to monitor and control intersections easily.
